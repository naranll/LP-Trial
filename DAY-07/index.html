        <p> From heroes to aliens, revoking the childlike "sense of wonder" in everyone's heart, <b>science fiction</b>
            has been
            a huge genre throughout the years. Some say sci-fi sprouted from the ancient myths of god, instead of
            supreme beings beyond sight it leans towards explorating time, space and artifical intelligence. Many of our
            current innovations have been predicted thanks to that. </p>
        <p> Now we are already in a new era thriving technology. YET...the majority remains to have negative views on
            the new inventions of our time. </p>
        <p> The culprit being "mainstream sci-fi".</p>
